# ISLR-cauldron
An Introduction to Statistical Learning (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, 2013): Python code. Inspired by `https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python`

This repository has all the exercises the `An Introduction to Statistical Learning` has in `R` but in `python`. The difference of this repository from `ISLR-python` is that instead of using Jupiter Notebooks, it will use [Cauldron](http://www.unnotebook.com/), `the unnotebook`. 

`Cauldron` provides a lot of benefits when compared to Jupiter Notebooks, it allows the user to: 
- Use his preferred editor. This will allow the user to get all the benefits from editors like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
- Code reviews are made easy. Instead of using blob file, it uses `.py` files. This will allow a smooth code review. 
- `Cauldron` is also ready for production. The user can use it's `CLI` to deploy their notebooks to production. 

Check all the benefits on [Cauldron](http://www.unnotebook.com/) site. 

`Cauldron` is free and open source!
